							<li>Aura components are self-contained & Reusable units of an app.</li>
							<li>Aura Component bundles are Component, Controller, Helper, Style, Documentation, Renderer, Design, SVG.</li>
							<li>To show Alert Dialogue box we use alert(".....") in Controller/Helper.</li>
							<li>For binding attribute values we use Ex: {!v.add}.</li>
							<li>For calling the controller in component we use Ex: {!c.doAdd}.</li>
							<li>If condition in Aura --> "<aura:if></aura:if>" and else condition --> "<aura:set></aura:set>".</li>

							<li>5 Batch jobs can be added in queue.</li>
							<li>To execute the Future classes we have to annotate as @future in class.</li>
							<li>Queueable classess must implement the interface like Queueable and it has Execute method in this method Batch chaining is possible.</li>
							<li>We can schedule a class by 2 methods they are by Configuration and by using Cron Operation.</li>
